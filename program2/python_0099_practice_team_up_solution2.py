They are defined as 2 list as below:
girls = ['Olivia','Emily','Lily','Emma','Mary']

Your program need to randomly(0039) divide them into 5 groups. Each group contains 1 boy & 1 girl.

import random

# PREPARE DATA BEGIN -----------------------------

girls = ['Olivia','Emily','Lily','Emma','Mary']
boys = ['Jack','David','Robert','James','John']

# MAIN PROGRAM BEGIN -----------------------------

# Logic: I can loop 5 times, each time randomly select a boy, randomly select a girl, team up, remove them for the 2 lists.
