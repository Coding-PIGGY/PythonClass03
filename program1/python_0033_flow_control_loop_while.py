IMPORTANT!!! ------------------------------------------

while boolean expression:
    <statement>
    <statement>
    <statement>
    
Step 1) Check the value of boolean expression    
Step 2) if it is True, run the code block under while clause, after that, go back to Step 1)
        if it is False, ignore the code block, while loop finishes. 

Summary: while loop repeats a code block until the while boolean expression becomes False

a = 1

while a < 10:
    print(a)
    a += 2 # last step is to update the loop condition
